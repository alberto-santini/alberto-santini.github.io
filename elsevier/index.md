# A note on publishing venues

## The state of the Scientific Publishing industry in general

The state of the scientific publishing industry is highly debated, and in particular the role of publishing companies is increasingly under scrutiny.

These companies have been compared to restaurants where the guests have to bring their own food (their research), cook it (present their findings in a paper), improve it under the scrutiny of severe food critics (the reviewers), who do their job for free, all run under the supervision of expert cooks (the editors), who also do their job for free. In the end, the restaurant's owner charges hefty prices to anyone who whishes (or has) to consume this food.

As Robert Darnton, past director of Harvard Library, has said: "We faculty do the research, write the papers, referee papers by other researchers, serve on editorial boards, all of it for free... and then we buy back the results of our labour at outrageous prices."

In the past, publishers could claim that none of this could have happened without them providing the metaphorical kitchen, table, chairs and cutlery that make up the restaurant. That is to say, publishers typeset and printed physical copies of the journals, and sent it to libraries and universities all over the world.

With the advent of digital publishing and the widespread use of the internet, however, the cost and complexity of electronically ditributing a document are asymptotically approaching zero. Scientific publishing seems to be one of the few areas where the advent of the internet did not disrupt the existing business model. Quite the contrary: the publishers have quickly reacted and embraced the change, while actually managing to increase their profits. And they haven't always done so in a clean and ethical way.

## The case of Elsevier, in particular

I think it's fair to say, however, that not all publishers are *equal*. The idea of a scientific publishing company certainly doesn't have anything inherently wrong. It would be desirable that a publisher added value to the advancement of science, by providing an infrastructure that facilitates the creation and the fruition of scientific works, and by keeping the quality bar high, ensuring an unbiased and severe peer-review process.

The critique of the current practices common to most publisher has been put forward by the [Cost of Knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com/) initiative. The promoters of the initiative suggest that a first, reasonable target for an acadmic boycott of for-profit publishers should start from Elsvier. In short, this publishing company:
* Charges high prices for their journals, with opaque transparent strategies;
* Forces libraries to buy journal in bundles, thereby making them pay for journals they have no interest in;
* Is a terrible steward for its own journals (does the "[Chaos, Solitons & Fractals](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mohamed_El_Naschie)" scandal ring a bell?);
* Lobbies for SOPA, PIPA, and other regulation that aims to limit the exchange of knoledge;
* Filed lawsuits against [Science Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) and [Library Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis);
* Heck, they even tried to [patent peer-review](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/stupid-patent-month-elsevier-patents-online-peer-review)!
The O.R. community has not been unsensitive to this topic: Martin Grötschel, László Lóvasz, Günter Ziegler, for example, all were among the initial promoters and signatories of The Cost of Knowledge.

That said, I decided to agree to the initiative and, in the future, I will not publish on Elsevier-published journals. I will also, should the occasion ever arise, refuse to be part of editorial boards of journals published by Elsevier.

### Wait, but you *did* publish on Elsevier journals!

Yes, I did. Consider, however, that submissions to those journals happened before I was made aware of the issues afflicting the state of scientific publishing in general, and the existence of a boycott against Elsevier in particular. I was very new to the academic world, and I still am: while writing this I still have to complete the final months of my PhD. Also consider that the publishing process can easily span over three years (e.g. a paper submitted in 2015, which finally gets accepted after a couple of rounds of review in 2016, and is finally published in 2017). So, expect not to see any work of mine on any Elsevier journal with a publishing year equal or greater to 2019.

### What about referee work?

I will keep doing referee work for anyone who asks, no matter what journal they are editors for. In my opinion, refusing to do referee work is akin to being an ICU doctor who refuese to treat a patient because he is on strike. The refereeing process is what keeps science credible, reliable, trustworthy. Without refereeing there is no scientific knowledge.
