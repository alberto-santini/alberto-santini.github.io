Project TRABADUM (**Tra**nsport Públic de **Ba**rcelona per a la **D**istribució **U**rbana de **M**ercaderies) studies the use of Public Transport for last-mile deliveries in the city of Barcelona.
We are an interdisciplinary team of researchers and practitioners from Barcelona, who want to make e-commerce delivery more sustainable and friendly.

## Background

The rapid growth of e-commerce has resulted in a massive increase of home deliveries.
While the convenience of such a distribution method is undeniable, it has also brought undesirable externalities: pollution, traffic, noise, incivic behaviour, to name a few.

The [Municipality of Barcelona](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/), through its [Municipal Mobility Plan](https://www.barcelona.cat/mobilitat/en/about-us/urban-mobility-plan), wants to address these concerns.
Among the proposed measures, it wants to create a logistics micro-hub in each neighbourhood: a shared platform in which retailers and distributors consolidate their shipments.
From the micro-hub packets will reach the final customers using zero-emission vehicles, such as cargo bikes.

## Research question

Such a system has a great potential to reduce the externalities produced by last-mile delivery, but it leaves a question open: *how will the parcels arrive to the micro-hubs in the first place*?
With our project we want to explore a better alternative to using trucks to bring goods up to the micro-hubs: we want to use spare capacity on public transport!

Is it technically possible to do so?
How would such a system work in practice?
What environmental, economic, social benefits could derive from it?
We have gathered a diverse team to answer these questions!
