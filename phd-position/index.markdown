## The research project

The student will be financed through the research project "Fairness and social well-being in optimisation models".
The overarching theme of this project is incorporating ethical aspects into mathematical models for public resource allocation and labour organisation.
Specifically, the project aims to include fairness and social well-being considerations in optimisation models through two research lines: fairness in public budget allocation models and workers' well-being in service industry optimisation models.

The IP of the project is [Alberto Santini](/files/cv.pdf), associate professor of Operational Research at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
Among his publications, the ones that most align with this project are the following:
* Malaguti, E., Paronuzzi, P., & Santini, A. (2026). [Algorithms and Complexity Results for the 0â€“1 Knapsack Problem with Group Fairness](/files/papers/malaguti-paronuzzi-santini-2026.pdf).
* Mandal, M. P., Santini, A., & Archetti, C. (2025). [Tactical workforce sizing and scheduling decisions for last-mile delivery](/files/papers/mandal-santini-archetti-2025.pdf).
* Delle Donne, D., Santini, A., & Archetti, C. (2025). [Integrating Public Transport in Sustainable Last-Mile Delivery: Column Generation Approaches](/files/papers/delle-donne-santini-archetti-2025.pdf).
* Santini, A., Viana, A., Klimentova, X., & Pedroso, J.P. (2022). [The probabilistic travelling salesman problem with crowdsourcing](/files/papers/santini-viana-klimentova-pedroso-2022.pdf).

We also particularly encourage interdisciplinary research with professors in adjacent areas (e.g., the [Data Science Centre](https://datascience.bse.eu/team-gse/)).

Master's students who are expected to complete their degree by Summer 2026 are also eligible to apply.
* All candidates will be evaluated based on their academic accomplishments, previous research experience, and fit with the project.
* Candidates must have excellent English and scientific writing skills.
* Candidates with proven experience in programming and data science are particularly appreciated.

* The scholarship comes with generous funding to cover research expenses, such as travelling to conferences or stays abroad.
* Complete fee waiver.
* UPF offers plenty of opportunities for career growth, including research and soft-skills seminars.
