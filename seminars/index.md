# OR Seminars

I organise a series of seminars/webinars, with the aim to increase the exposure of PhD students and young researchers, foster cross-fertilisation between different fields of OR, and provide a friendly environment to discuss and receive feedback.

The link to follow the live webinars and interact with the presenter is [here](http://webconference.unibo.it/or-seminar).
